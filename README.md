# Java Projects

A collection of Java projects I’ve worked on, including small games, audio visualizers, and interactive experiments. These were built using Java and the [Processing](https://processing.org/) library, and cover a range of programming concepts like OOP, file handling, graphics, and user interaction.

Feel free to explore and run the code. 🎮🎧

## Folders

## Getting Started
Make sure to have [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) or a compatible Java setup. Then, clone the repo and run your chosen `.java` file.
